**Week 11 Assignment 
**

Used start.spring.io to create a “web” project. 

Edited the code in the DemoApplication.java file in the src/main/java/com/example/demo folder.

Checked Spring Boot application by running the program, and entering http://localhost:8080/students and http://localhost:8080/classes into my browser address bar. 

I also tested added /1 and /CPT-127 to get the information for an individual student and class, and verify the Spring could display specific classes and students based on id's specified.
