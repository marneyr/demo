**Week 11 Assignment 
**

Used start.spring.io to create a “web” project. 

Edited the code in the DemoApplication.java file in the src/main/java/com/example/demo folder.

Checked Spring Boot application by running the program, and entering http://localhost:8080/hello into my browser address bar. 

I also tested added ?name=Sam, to get the output, Hello Sam!, and verify the Spring could take inputs.
